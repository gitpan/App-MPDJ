DESCRIPTION
    "App::MPDJ" is an automatic DJ for your "MPD" server. It will manage a
    queue of random songs for you just like a real DJ.

OPTIONS

        Sets the MPD connection details. See Audio::MPD#host for more
        information.

    -v, --verbose
        Makes the output verbose. Default is to be quiet.

    --no-daemon
        Run in the foreground instead of trying to fork and exit.

    -b, --before
        Number of songs to keep in the playlist before the current song. The
        default is 2.

    -a, --after
        Number of songs to queue up in the playlist after the current song.
        The default is 2.

    -c, --calls-freq
        Frequency in seconds for call signs to be injected. The default is
        3600 (one hour). A value of 0 will disable call sign injection.

        Path to music files. The default is 'music'.

        means no crossfading will happen.
